# hw1- Manual Review

The homework will be based on this project named "Expense Tracker",where users will be able to add/remove daily transaction. 

## Compile

To compile the code from terminal, use the following command:
```
cd src
javac ExpenseTrackerApp.java
java ExpenseTracker
```

You should be able to view the GUI of the project upon successful compilation. 

## Java Version
This code is compiled with ```openjdk 17.0.7 2023-04-18```. Please update your JDK accordingly if you face any incompatibility issue.

## Undo Functionality Added
A "Remove Transaction" button has been added on UI. It can be used to select any one transaction and click on this button to remove the transaction record from UI and all calculations/considerations......hence works as an "undo" on any specified transaction
